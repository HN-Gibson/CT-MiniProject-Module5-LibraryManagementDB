# CT-MiniProject-Module5-LibraryManagementDB
**Presenting a Library Database Management Program**

**Welcome and thank you for using my program!**

**Goal of the program**
To offer a seemless means of managing a library database containing book info, author info, user info, and allow for easy check-in and check-out features.

**Important Notes:**
- There are three primary collections in the library that you will access via different menus.
    1. The Library Database
    2. The User Database
    3. The Author Database
- Throughout the program, you will be given the option to return to the main menu when met with a menu. Please pay attention to the menu options as they are presented.
- The only means of quitting the program is from the main menu. So, when you're finished using the features of one menu, return to the main menu if you would like to exit.
- When navigating the menus, leaving inputs blank (i.e. Hitting enter without typing an input) may result in having to re-enter information.
